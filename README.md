# Work-Rise-Public

Work & Rise is dedicated the economic empowerment of all Ugandans.

The public repository for Work &amp; Rise, detailing technical specifications for professional inquiries &amp; investment research. Beta Release set for Friday, December 29th.

The full repository is not Open-Source software, and therefore unavailable for public consumption. Partial or full exceptions can be made for regulatory inquiries, as well as due-diligence efforts towards investment and/or bilateral business agreements.

On a general level, the application is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React.JS for view-rendering rendering & Express.JS for back-end routing. Our production database is PostgreSQL, with multiple countermeasures for security. 

We are currently integrating with PesaMoni to provide payment functionality through our platform - for information, please refer to https://www.pesamoni.com

We use Webpack to bundle our production build together, hosted on an Amazon EC2 Instance with our production database sitting on the AWS Relational Database Service, along with a few AWS Lambda functions using the Serverless Framework.

If you have any technical questions or would like to partner with us as an Employer or Marketing Sponsor, please reach out to director@mikhaelbd.com
