* Free Membership
To sign up and create an account, the users of the site do not pay any membership fees. Also finding service providers and jobs is allowed for free.
* Delivery of payments to service providers
CiL disburses funds to service providers to their chosen payment method (after deducting CiL commission), following payment instructions provided to CiL within 30 days after the service provider’s fees are due and payable from Client. Service provider agrees that it will not receive interest or other earnings on the funds held by CiL prior to disbursement to service provider. For the avoidance of doubt, service provider further agrees CiL or our Affiliates may charge or deduct fees, may receive a reduction in fees or expenses charged, and may receive other compensation from financial services firms and other third parties in connection with the services they provide.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, and except as prohibited by applicable law, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have violated the conditions and restrictions of the Site, CiL may hold the disbursement of the service provider’s Fees. Additionally, CiL may also hold the disbursement of the fees if: (a) we require additional information, such as service provider’s tax information, government-issued identification, address, or date of birth; (b) we have reason to believe the fees may be subject to dispute or chargeback; (c) we suspect fraud; (d) we believe there are reasonable grounds for insecurity with respect to the performance of obligations under a Service Contract, this Agreement, or other Terms of Service; (e) we deem necessary in connection with any investigation; or (f) required by applicable law.
In cases of fraud, abuse, or violation of this Agreement, CiL reserves the right to revoke any payments. In addition, we reserve the right to seek reimbursement from you, and you will reimburse us, if we suspect fraud or criminal activity associated with your payment, withdrawal, or Engagement; if we discover erroneous or duplicate transactions; or if we have supplied our services in accordance with this Agreement yet we receive any chargeback from the Payment Method used by you, or used by your Client if you are a service provider. You agree that we have the right to obtain such reimbursement by charging the account you hold with us, offsetting any amounts determined to be owing, deducting amounts from future payments or withdrawals, charging your Payment Method, or obtaining reimbursement from you by any other lawful means. Failure to pay for reimbursements of chargebacks is cause for termination of our services to you.
* Payment of Taxes
CiL has no responsibility for determining the necessity of or for determining, remitting, or withholding any taxes applicable to the service provider’s fees. Service provider will be solely responsible for determining whether it is required by applicable law to determine whether: (a) service provider or Cil is required to remit to the appropriate authorities any value added tax or any other taxes or similar charges applicable to the Fees and remitting any such taxes or charges to the appropriate authorities on behalf of service provider or CiL, as appropriate. In the event of an audit of CiL, service provider agrees to promptly cooperate with CiL and provide copies of service provider’s tax returns and other documents as may be reasonably requested for purposes of such audit.

User hereby authorizes CiL to run credit card authorizations on all credit cards provided by user, to store credit card and banking or other financial details as Client’s method of payment for Services, and to charge Client’s credit card (or any other Payment Method). Credit cards and PayPal accounts and, if applicable, bank accounts in most countries will be charged by CiL.
By providing Payment Method information through the Site, user represents, warrants, and covenants that: (a) User is legally authorized to provide such information to us; (b) User is legally authorized to perform payments using the Payment Method(s); and (c) such action does not violate the terms and conditions applicable to User’s use of such Payment Method(s) or applicable law.

To the extent that any amounts owed under this Agreement cannot be collected from User’s Payment Method(s), user is solely responsible for paying such amounts by other means.
Unless otherwise agreed to in a writing signed by both Client and service provider, the default terms and conditions of the Service Contract that a service provider enters directly with a Client when the service provider agrees to provide services to the Client are applicable. Service provider will perform his/her services in a professional and workmanlike manner and will deliver any agreed upon Work Product. The manner and means of performing the services shall be determined and controlled by the service provider.
