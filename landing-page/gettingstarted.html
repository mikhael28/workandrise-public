  How do I position Myself to Win Jobs on workandrise.com?
  Service providers are central to our community. Without you, workandrise.com is not complete – our success is directly tied to your success. Below we provide guidelines on how you can position yourself to win jobs and succeed in this wonderful global community.
  Create a strong profile
  At workandrise.com you are as good as your profile. When creating your profile make sure you describe your skills, education, experience, previous engagements, rates and everything about yourself precisely and concisely. Do not tell a lie. A complete, professional-looking profile generally includes at least your full name, title, and photo. You can even upload recommendations from previous clients!
  Always position yourself as a professional
  Always remember that our clients are looking for professionals, and how you present yourself matters a lot. Make sure that you are always polite, well-mannered, and respectful in everything you do here, from the content of your profile to your proposals. Do not give clients a reason to doubt your talents.
  Master your communication skills
  workandrise.com is a virtual marketplace where employers are constantly looking for talented service providers– but you do not get to see your next employer! Thus to keep your employer happy, make sure you always talk, and be very clear and respectful when communicating. When bidding for a job, try the following tips:
  * For every message you send out, read it one more time before you click SEND. Make sure there are no errors and you say what you want to say.
  * Always make sure you understand what the client wants. In your conversations, document the deliverables, timelines and everything the client wants. It is always very important to set expectations and agree before you start the work.
  * Do not take ages to respond to questions and messages – do so very quickly.
  * Use the Message Center to document all agreements and discussions between yourself and your client.
  * Be open about your availability. Let your client know when you’re online and when you’re unavailable.
  * Consider sending your client regular updates.
  * When in doubt, ask! Don’t be afraid to contact your client with project-related questions or concerns.
  * If you’re going to miss an agreed deadline, tell your client as soon as possible! Tell them why you can’t meet the deadline and propose a new date for delivery.
  * If you can’t complete a contract, tell your client and workandrise.com immediately.
  Always remember you’re your Own Boss – and this requires discipline
  At workandrise.com you have no supervisor. It is up to you to market your skills, advertise your services, set your rates and payment terms, find the right engagements, determine how to perform your work, and invest in your own success. To achieve greater success, you need to have discipline in the way you manage time, deliverables and promises.
  Be enterprising
  You need to have an entrepreneurial spirit, a strong work ethic, and consistently deliver great results in time. With these values, you’ll definitely succeed on our platform.
  Send application for only the right job
  Do not apply for any job you see on workandrise.com – go for only the right job. A right job is one which fits into your skills set, education and person specification. To increase your chances of winning jobs, apply for jobs you can do well. Once you do a job well, you’ll have satisfied a client who will refer others to you. That way, your freelance business will grow.
  Make sure every proposal you send out is convincing and outstanding
  Before you send a proposal, make sure you understand the job properly. Your cover letter to your application has to be well written and should respond to the specific needs of the job. A client will have a second look at your proposal if it catches his or her attention. Never copy and paste previous proposals as this can always be seen. Talk about your skills, experience and availability.
  When invited for an interview, do your homework and prepare well for it
  Prepare for your interview just as you would for a face-to-face job interview. During your preparation, make sure you review the job requirements, write down some questions to ask about the job, and be ready to discuss your skills. Test your computer and speakers, charge your phone, and double-check that your Skype, chat, or other communication software is working. Make sure your internet connectivity is fine.
  During the interview, you’ll want to be on time and ready to talk specifically about why you’re qualified. Ask about schedules, deliverables, and what your client expects. Be polite, friendly, and be sure to thank them at the end.
  Be reliable
  Being reliable means that you honour your promises and you’re there whenever needed. Do not promise what you’ll not be able to deliver. This is extremely important. Set and communicate realistic expectations, meet deadlines, and always do your best work. You need to have a functional computer, internet connection, and other technical tools.

  How do I get the best service provider for my job?
  workandrise.com is a place where you’ll find great service providers, talented and coming from different parts of the world. We break dependency on local talent alone and bring you talent from all around the world! To ensure that you get the best talent for your job, follow the guidelines below:
  Present yourself professionally
  If you are to attract professional service providers, you need to describe your business or yourself professionally. You need to use clear language, be respectful and business-like. Write job posts that are complete and professional, and add a verified payment method to demonstrate your business legitimacy. The payment method could be paypal, debit or credit card or mobile money number. This way you will be seen by highly qualified service providers, and they will definitely be interested in working for you.
  Put some effort and initiative
  Always remember that there are many people who can do your work. However, getting the very best from workandrise.com will require you to put some effort and initiative. Below are a few steps you may take:
  * Think about the job you want to be done before you post it. Describe your job, define deliverables and be clear on the timelines. When you post the job, let the service providers answer a few questions when responding to it. These answers can help you in identifying who to interview.
  * Make a reasonable offer for your job. Do not offer to little otherwise you’ll attract novices to your job. A good rate will attract skilled service providers, and these will deliver your project quite well.
  * If you don’t like a service provider, simply decline contacting them. This will help them to look for other opportunities.
  * For the service providers you choose to talk to, make sure you review all information about them before you set an interview. We recommend that you interview a couple of them before you zero down on a single one to hire.
  * If your project is big, you can test the competence of the service provider by offering a small portion. This will help to verify whether they can do the work or not. This is the advantage of hiring through workandrise.com.
  Be very clear in your communications
  Do not hire a service provider and sit back without follow-up communications. Always be in touch to ensure you understand how work is progressing. A few tips here:
  * Have an inception meeting with the service provider and set your expectations clear. Remember, the more information you share the better.
  * Make sure you ask for regular progress reports from the service provider. This could be daily, weekly or bi-monthly, depending on the size of the project. If there are discrepancies between the work you receive and the work agreed, engage the service provider to address these in time. If you are unable to do that, we are available to help.
  * Be available to provide any additional information that the service provider may want
  * Always be thankful when a service provider does a good job.
  Share your honest experience with a give service provider
  We all depend on honest and objective feedback. Once the contract is over, please take some time off to share your experience with other clients using the workandrise.com marketplace.
